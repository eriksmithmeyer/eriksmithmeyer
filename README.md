Hi, I'm Erik from Norway and I help companies with data analysis all the way from wrangling of really messy data to creating reports. 

I have a PhD in Energy Finance along with a MSc and a BSc in Financial Economics.

My ultimate goal is to help you to get clear and robust answers from data. Service is my middle name :-)

I have been lecturing on finance, econometrics, data engineering, and programming for business students for several years. Also, I have worked in the banking and risk management sector with statistics and programming.
